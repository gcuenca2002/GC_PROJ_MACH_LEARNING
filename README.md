COURSERA PROJECT MACHINE LEARNING
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.
This project is about to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. 
It is possible to use any of the other variables to predict with.
